Plot of the quadric surface, Eq.~\eqref{eq:standard}, resulting from the eigenvalues, $\lambda_1 = 10.42526019$, $\lambda_2= 1.35965812$ and $\lambda_3 = -5.78491831$ of a matrix (see \emph{Classification of Degenerate Surfaces - Derivation and Full Explanations} and  \emph{Quadric\_Code.ipynb} of \cite{sgalbr17_AMA3020_Quadrics}) in principal-axis co-ordinates $(x',y',z')$; the surface generated is, hence, a hyperboloid of one sheet, centred at $(x',y',z')=(0,0,0)$. The gradient colouring of the surface corresponds to the value of $z'$, as shown by the corresponding coloured bar on the right-side of the plot.
