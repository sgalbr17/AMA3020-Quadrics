Plot of the quadric surface, Eq.~\eqref{eq:standard}, arising from the eigenvalues, $\lambda_1 = -8.33688233$, $\lambda_2 = -1.84395736$ and $\lambda_3 = 14.18083969$ of a symmetric matrix (see \emph{Classification of Degenerate Surfaces - Derivation and Full Explanations} and \emph{Quadric\_Code.ipynb} of \cite{sgalbr17_AMA3020_Quadrics}), in the principal-axis co-ordinates $(x',y',z')$, centred at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The colour gradient surface generated is a surface with two sheets  - the hyperboloid of two sheets - with the colour corresponding to the $z$-value, indicated by the coloured bar on the right-side of the plot.
